As you peak out from the bushes, you recognise the faces of several goblins. Suddenly, they all go quiet. You feel heavy breathing from your back. Swearving around, you see 3 goblins have snuck up on you and have conered you! You can run or you can try to attack.


## Ambush - Bandits - YYOUNG

## Engradoland - Shababy
You have escaped the Ambush and run through the forest, you trip on a stone.

When you come to your senses you look up to see a large city bustling with people. You go into a blacksmith shop and get an armour set. When you come out a shady looking guy tells you that you look like a hobo and tells you a dungeon has a bunch of gold for you to get. :)

## Start of Dungon - YYOUNG 
You go to the dungeon and find your dad and a baby dragon, can either fight the dragon or try to run and save your dad. One will lead you to glorious victory and the other will lead to death. Find the dragon's weakness and slay him and leave your dad to die or try to save your father from his impending doom. Choose Wisely!!

## Treasure Room -
You're surrounded by riches, its unlike you've ever seen before because you're a BROKEY. You jump up and down like its a trampoline until you wonder, how are you gonna take it all home and where is home? You start stuffing it into your clothing until you look like a heavily pregnant woman. You start taking your first steps out when 2 artefacts catch your eye. One is a sword on a pedestal and the other is a (IDK SOMEONE PLEASE FIX IT).

As you enter the settlement you awe at the massive towers, markets, houses and The castle in the center. Once the awe wears off you decide to go to (can go to two different places)
The market: you enter the bustling market with traders abundant, selling everything from silks and clothes to iron and gold, what do you buy?:
Copper armor (Level 3) for 15 gold coins
Iron armor (Level 1) for 20 gold coins
Hunter's armor (Light) for 20 gold coins
The tavern:
as you enter the tavern you hear the ramble of conversations and fight, but in the corner of this tavern there is a mysterious stranger who is eminating a strange aura.

as you approach the mysterious strange he just stares at you until you ask him what this aura is, which that is when he gives you a map and dissapears into a cloud of smoke

when you look at the map it has marked a mountain and when you leave the tavern you see that mountain coverd in purple magic with a storm circling the mountain.

## Cave Encounter #2 - LUKAS
After the floor gives way, your fall a long way till you blackout. When you come to your senses in a cave, it is dark so you stumble around for what seems like hours. Then, you see what seems to be campers hideout. You hide behind some rocks but they see you. Your choices are to run away or fight. If you run you die from a sudden fall in the dark. If you fight you can either use sword slash, stick stab or punch. Sword slash allows you to live all others result in death. When you kill the campers you get 20 gold, level 2 copper armor and a map. The map shows that you are very close to the exit, when you exit you see a large mountain with a menecing storm circling above it.

## The Walk Up - sabang
The trail above provided the tingle of mystery which you'd usually get when you have to present a speech in class. You clench your fist and start walking up the mountain like an angry toddler but instead you are full with pride. Well you're full of pride until you see another tiny green blob and you're humbled.

## Big Boss Fight - LUKAS
After the long, trecherous walk up to the top you see a mysterious cultist praying at a pedistal. You go closer to have a better look but you stumble on a stone and fall. the cultist hears you and suddenly begins to chant old magic spells. Whe you stand up, lightning begins to shoot out of the man. Do you hide or fight. if you hide the cultist uses his lightning for too long and destroys the world. If you fight your armor will be destroyed but the cultist will die if you use sword slash, you will loose 20 HP but get the cultists book of magic and cloak. As you are getting ready to leave a large floating eye flys over the mountain, in a book that you read a while ago you remember seeing that it is called the beholder, you also remember that it is the stongest thing in teh entiraty of Chaba'le La'd. The Beholder goes over towards the elven village to the east but it won't be long till it comes back, so you put on the cloak and begin reading the spells. About ten minutes later you can hear the screams from the elves in the village, you hide behind a rock then the beholder comes back. Do you try to fight? if you don't the beholder finds you when you are unexpecting and you get disintegrated. If you fight you can either use lighning strike or rock throw. If you use lighning strike it will be ineffective and you will get disintegrated, If you use rock throw you will levetate a boulder and it will squash the beholder and you will win.
